    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup potato starch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3/4 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine 1 cup potato starch, salt, and vegetable oil in a bowl. 
            Add a splash of boiling water at a time, stirring between additions, 
            until you get a perfectly textured dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer to a work surface dusted with a little potato starch. Working 
            quickly while the dough is still warm, knead, adding more potato starch if necessary, 
            until smooth and elastic.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Set out a large bowl of cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the water is boiling, roll dough to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut into 1/4-inch noodles with a pizza cutter. Separate noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add potato noodles (in batches if desired) and cook until they float, about 1 minute. Transfer to the bowl of cold water. Repeat to cook remaining noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk oyster sauce, soy sauce, rice vinegar, ketchup, sesame oil, sugar, and Sriracha together in a bowl.
        </li>
    </ol>
